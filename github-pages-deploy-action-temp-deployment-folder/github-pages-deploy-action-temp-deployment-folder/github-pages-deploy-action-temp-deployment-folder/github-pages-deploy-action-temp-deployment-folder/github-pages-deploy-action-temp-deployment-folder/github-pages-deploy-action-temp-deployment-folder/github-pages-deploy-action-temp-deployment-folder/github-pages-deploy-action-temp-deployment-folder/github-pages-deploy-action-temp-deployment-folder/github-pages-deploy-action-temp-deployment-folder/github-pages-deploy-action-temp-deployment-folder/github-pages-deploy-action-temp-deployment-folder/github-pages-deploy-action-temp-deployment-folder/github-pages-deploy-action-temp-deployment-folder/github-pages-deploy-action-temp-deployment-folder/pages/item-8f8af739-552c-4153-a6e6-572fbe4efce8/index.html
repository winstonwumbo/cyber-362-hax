<p>This three-credit studio course teaches fundamental data-driven cybersecurity analytics skills using programming skills introduced in other courses (e.g., IST 140).&#160;The course will be divided into five modules.&#160;</p>
<p>The first module introduces data-driven cybersecurity analytics, as well recapping on some of the related security issues covered in previous courses.&#160;The second module gets students prepared for cybersecurity analytics, by gaining familiarity with some data analytics software tools&#160; and platforms such as Python, SIEM, SOAR, etc.&#160;</p>
<p>The third module focuses on understanding and using some popular machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity analytics.&#160;&#160;The fourth module teaches how to apply data analytics processes and machine learning methods to selected cybersecurity problems such as anomaly detection, network traffic analysis, protecting the consumer web and internet-facing APIs, and deploying machine learning systems in production environments.&#160;</p>
<p>The team project is the fifth module.&#160; In this course, the students will improve their knowledge in cybersecurity analytics tools, methodologies, and processes; and how to apply them to real-world cybersecurity problems.</p>
<h2 id="header-e4094319-61e6-8d85-13b5-2170f9daea71">Objectives</h2>
<p>The purpose of this course is provide students fundamental knowledge and skills of using data analytics and machine learning methods to become more efficient in exploring, visualizing and recognizing the patterns that represent network threats as well as addressing them. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul><li>Understand and justify the needs for applying data analytics and/or machine learning methods for solving cybersecurity problems.</li><li>Understand and apply analytical software tools such as Python and TensorFlow  to solve Cybersecurity problems.</li><li>Apply data exploration and visualization methods to identify potential problems in security data (such as missing, outlier and skewness of data)</li><li>Prepare data and improve data quality for cybersecurity analytics.</li><li>Select, apply and evaluate appropriate machine learning methods to model and solve real world cybersecurity problems such as anomaly detection, network traffic analysis, etc.</li></ul>

<p>Homework assignments and quizzes are due on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. unless otherwise specified (see below). Submit all homework assignments via CANVAS.</p>
<p>Please ensure your homework assignment looks professional, is written professionally, and communicates your ideas clearly. Your writing should be accurate in diction, spelling, punctuation, grammar, and sentence structure. Points will be deducted for not pay attention to assignment instructions.</p>
<p><span>Please note the following: </span></p>
<ul><li>Assessments (labs, quizzes, and homework assignments) are due on <b>Sunday at 11:59PM (EST)</b> in most cases but that may be subject to change in some cases.</li>
<li>The projects deliverables due dates will be provided in class and on Canvas.</li><li>The final exam will take place towards the end of the semester and the exact date and time will be made available towards the end of the semester.</li><li>Students may submit late homework with the penalty of <b>25% deduction for every 12 hours late (up to 2 days)</b> but this is highly discouraged</li>
<li>After <b>2 days</b>, no more late submission is allowed</li>
</ul>
<p>We anticipate that there may be unforeseen circumstances or medical emergencies that make it difficult to turn in homework assignments on time. Email me in advance if possible about such situations. I will grant you an extension of at most 48 hours for you to submit the homework assignment without penalty. I may request supporting documentation depending on the type of unforeseen circumstance or medical emergency. I urge you not to use such an extension except when there is an emergency.</p>
