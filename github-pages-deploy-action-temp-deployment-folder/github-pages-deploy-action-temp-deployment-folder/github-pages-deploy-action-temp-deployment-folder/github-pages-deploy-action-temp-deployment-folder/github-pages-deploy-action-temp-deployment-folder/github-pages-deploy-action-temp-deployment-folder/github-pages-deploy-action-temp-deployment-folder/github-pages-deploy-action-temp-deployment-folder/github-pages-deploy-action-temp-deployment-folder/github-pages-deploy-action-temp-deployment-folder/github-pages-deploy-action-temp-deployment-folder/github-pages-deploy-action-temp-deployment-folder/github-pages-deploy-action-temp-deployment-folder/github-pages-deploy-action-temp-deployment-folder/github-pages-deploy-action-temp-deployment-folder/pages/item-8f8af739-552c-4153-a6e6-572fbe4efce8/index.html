<p>This three-credit studio course teaches fundamental data-driven cybersecurity analytics skills using programming skills introduced in other courses (e.g., IST 140).&#160;The course will be divided into five modules.&#160;</p>
<p>The first module introduces data-driven cybersecurity analytics, as well recapping on some of the related security issues covered in previous courses.&#160;The second module gets students prepared for cybersecurity analytics, by gaining familiarity with some data analytics software tools&#160; and platforms such as Python, SIEM, SOAR, etc.&#160;</p>
<p>The third module focuses on understanding and using some popular machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity analytics.&#160;&#160;The fourth module teaches how to apply data analytics processes and machine learning methods to selected cybersecurity problems such as anomaly detection, network traffic analysis, protecting the consumer web and internet-facing APIs, and deploying machine learning systems in production environments.&#160;</p>
<p>The team project is the fifth module.&#160; In this course, the students will improve their knowledge in cybersecurity analytics tools, methodologies, and processes; and how to apply them to real-world cybersecurity problems.</p>
