<p><b>A radically simple approach to web authoring and content ownership. </b>The goal of <b>HAX</b> is simple: to help people create rich and engaging web content without needing to understand web code.</p>
<p><b>HAX</b> is an <u>open-source</u> ecosystem built right here at Penn State! <b>HAX</b> is built with vanilla <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>LitElement</b> on the <b>Web Component</b> standard. The idea is online content should always be accessible, even as third-party frameworks age and diverge.</p>
<p><span>This thriving community is led by</span> <b>Project Lead Bryan Ollendyke </b><span>and Faculty Fellow</span> <b>Dr. David Fusco</b><span>. HAX </span>involves a variety of fields including programming (full stack), UI/UX design, Data Sciences/AI, learning design, education technology development, and more.</p>
