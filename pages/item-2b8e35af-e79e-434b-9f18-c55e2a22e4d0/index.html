<p>The <b>command line interface (CLI)</b>, or <b>terminal</b>, is a powerful, text-based environment for interacting with your computer. <b>CLI</b> tools are extremely common in the IT industry across development, cybersecurity, and more. The <b>CLI</b> has remained a core component of every major operating system for decades. Becoming familiar with such tools will be an incredibly valuable, long-lasting skill. Although you may not be familiar with the term <b>CLI</b>, you've likely heard of some of the following software (which are all <b>CLIs</b>!):</p>
<ul><li><b>Windows</b>: Command Prompt, PowerShell</li>
<li><b>macOS</b>: Terminal</li>
<li><b>Linux</b>: Konsole, GNOME Console</li>
</ul>
<p>The most common action that you'll perform in the command line will likely be <b>1. moving between folders</b> and <b>2. listing folder contents</b>.</p>
<p>To move between folders, you will use the same&#160;<b>cd </b>command on every operating system. <b>cd </b>is short for "Change Directory." Entering <b>cd </b>by itself (with no other text) will automatically bring you back to your home folder (<b>/home/&lt;username&gt; </b>on macOS/Linux, <b>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;</b> on WIndows). You can use another command <b>pwd </b>to confirm where you're located. <b>pwd </b>is short for "Print Working Directory."</p>
<p><b>$ </b>will represent separate lines of terminal commands.</p>
